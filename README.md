# BlockbasedElevators
A Spigot server plugin for minecraft version 1.18.2

This plugin allows for the creation of simple elevators using only blocks. It was created 
to help my understanding of the Spigot plugin development process. <br>
Therefore I don't know if I will continue to work on this. But I wanted to put it on here, 
so it might help others understand Spigot a bit more.

## Usage
The elevators are entirely based on blocks. A floor is made up a + shape made of configured
blocks. Elevators and floors get created and added by simply using them. New floors are added 
by using them once after being built.

The blocks of a floor need to be placed in the following configuration, <br>
&nbsp; X <br>
XCX<br>
&nbsp; X <br>
where C and X are the materials set in the configuration file.
